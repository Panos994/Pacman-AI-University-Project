# Pacman AI - University Project

## Overview
This project is part of **UC Berkeley's AI exercises**, focusing on optimizing **Pacman search algorithms**. The implementation involves depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), uniform cost search (UCS), A* search, and food heuristics to improve Pacman's decision-making.

## Repository Structure
- The entire project is inside the branch **"project"** in the repository.
- Main files that were updated:
  - `search.py`
  - `multiAgents.py`
  - `search.py` (listed twice, ensure correctness)
- Includes an **autograder** to check results.

## Features
- **Search Algorithms:** DFS, BFS, UCS, A*
- **Heuristics:** Implemented heuristics to optimize food collection
- **Evaluation:** Uses an **autograder** to validate implementation correctness
- **Bonus Point Achieved:** **Final score: 32/31 (+1 bonus point)**

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Install **Python 3**
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Panos994/Pacman-AI-University-Project.git
