# Pacman-AI-University-Project
The whole project is inside the branch called "project" in my repo's branches.
This is a UC Berkeley's AI exercises for making PACMAN searching algorithms optimized. (DFS, BFS, UCS, A*, food heuristics etc). Files that I update is search.py, multiAgents.py and search.py. It also includes an autograder to check the results (python autograder.py). My results after the exercise was 32/31 (+1 for a bonus point).
